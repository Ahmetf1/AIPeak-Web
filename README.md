## 🚀 Motivation

Previously, I had a web portfolio for myself hosted at <a href="https://kamranbekirov.com">kamranbekirov.com</a> built with HTML and CSS. While learning Flutter web I tought it might be interesting to build the same website but now using Flutter web and responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop) in mind. On that journey I've added many animations to make website interactive.

The codebase is open-source and rich of comments. Altough you can use it anyway you want, beware that it (my old website that was built with HTML and CSS to be more specific) was inspired and cloned from open-source template called <a href="https://html5up.net/solid-state">Solid state</a>. So, in case of usage I suggest you to respect its authors, do not use my personal logo as it is yours. 🤓
